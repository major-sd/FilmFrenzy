The Ticket Show Application is a web-based application that allows multiple users to book movie tickets for different shows under different venues. The application has two parties - an admin and users. The admin can add/edit/delete movie shows, venues, and users, while the users can browse movies, view show timings, and book tickets. The web application consists multiple APIâ€™s to add/edit/delete venues and shows by the admin side.


## Tech Stack

- Flask: web framework for building the web application
- Flask-SQLAlchemy: ORM for connecting to the database and performing CRUD operations
- Flask-Login: extension for user authentication and authorization
- Werkzeug for password hashing
- SQLite: database for storing user, shows, venues and booking data
- Bootstrap: Bootstrap version 4.1 is used in this project for the HTML styling and overall frontend designing. 


## Database Schema
- Venues - This table stores the details of the venues which includes fields like ID, Name, Location and Capacity.

## Architecture and Features
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm is used to organise the entire project. The controllers for processing requests and rendering templates are located in the views module of the application package. Controllers for handling user authentication and authorisation are present in the authentication module. Classes for database tables can be found in the models module. The HTML view templates are located in the templates folder. The application provides user registration and login, CRUD of shows/venues by admin, booking of shows by users, user ratings, distribution of dynamic average ratings to shows based on users' ratings, and multiple bookings by users. Moreover, the user can alter their username and password in My Profile section.
